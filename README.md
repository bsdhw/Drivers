# Drivers
The collection of files to help find drivers for devices:

* freebsd — list of supported devices in the FreeBSD kernel
* openbsd — list of supported devices in the OpenBSD kernel
* netbsd  — list of supported devices in the NetBSD kernel
* other/nvidia  — NVIDIA FreeBSD Graphics Driver READMEs
* other/kms-drm — list of supported devices by kms-drm (DRM part of the linuxkpi-based KMS)
* other/drm-legacy — list of supported devices by drm-legacy (legacy DRM modules for the linuxkpi-based KMS components)

Lists of supported devices in *BSD kernels may be inaccurate. Please help improve them!
